1-Activity - In this activity, I learned how to create and manipulate arrays using NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical computing. I started by generating a one-dimensional array containing the first 10 positive integers using np.arange(). Then explored key properties of the array such as its shape and data type, which are essential for understanding how data is stored and processed in NumPy. Finally, we demonstrated how to perform element-wise operations by multiplying each element of the array by 2, showcasing NumPyâ€™s efficiency and simplicity in handling mathematical operations on arrays.

Summary: This activity involves working with NumPy to manipulate and explore arrays. You'll create a NumPy array containing the first 10 positive integers, analyze its structure by printing its shape and data type, and perform element-wise operations by multiplying each value by 2. It's a practical exercise to understand the basics of NumPy arrays and their functionality. ðŸ˜Š
