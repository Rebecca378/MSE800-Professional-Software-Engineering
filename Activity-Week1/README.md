1-Activity - In this activity, I learnt how to create and manipulate arrays using NumPy, a powerful Python library for numerical computing. I started by generating a one-dimensional array containing the first 10 positive integers using np.arange(). Then explored key properties of the array such as its shape and data type, which are essential for understanding how data is stored and processed in NumPy. Finally, I demonstrated how to perform element-wise operations by multiplying each element of the array by 2, showcasing NumPyâ€™s efficiency and simplicity in handling mathematical operations on arrays.

2-Activity - This activity involved analysing student scores using a 2D NumPy array. I used axis=1 with np.mean() to calculate the average per student (row-wise) and axis=0 to calculate the average per subject (column-wise). I identified the top-scoring student by summing each row (axis=1) and using np.argmax(). Finally, I added 5 bonus points to the third subject for all students using scores[:, 2] += 5. This demonstrates how NumPy simplifies data analysis through efficient array operations.

## Summary: 
In these activities, I learnt to efficiently create, manipulate, and analyse NumPy arrays. I explored key array properties like shape and data type, performed element-wise operations, calculated averages using axes, identified the highest values, and modified data systematically. These tasks highlighted NumPy's simplicity and power in handling numerical computations and data analysis. ðŸ˜Š
